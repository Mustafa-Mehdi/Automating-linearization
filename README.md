# Automating-linearization
Given a particular graph, the code searches for maximum slope, disconnects the graph from the point where slope is maximum, makes a linear line and then reconnects it with the upper part of the graph, this is done using pandas.
The upper defined implementation is done for entire files means selecting *.csv files in a folder would create graphs of all the files present in a folder.
