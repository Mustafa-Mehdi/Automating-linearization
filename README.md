# Automating-linearization
Given a particular graph, the code searches for maximum slope, disconnects the graph from the point where slope is maximum, makes a linear line and then reconnects it with the upper part of the graph, this is done using pandas.
The upper defined implementation is done for entire files meaning selecting *.csv files in a folder would create graphes which are all present in a folder.
